Satan, the famous mathematician dies and goes to hell. The satan tells him, that if he can solve his puzzle, then Cantor will be shifted to heaven. So the initial problem is, that the satan writes an integer on a paper and asks Cantor to develop a scheme to guess the number. Cantor has infinite attempts and at each attempt Satan will only tell if the answer was right or wrong. Cantor succesfully develops a scheme to guess the number (pretty straight forward). Then, Satan says that he will write two numbers on the paper and he Cantor has to similarly guess them in correct order. Cantor, again develops a scheme successfully. The Satan goes on increasing the number of integers and yet, Cantor always develops a scheme successfuly. Finally, Satan says that he will write some number of integers on the paper and Cantor has to guess them in correct order. Can Cantor guess them successfully?

Your aim is to (a) write a code, which will give all the guesses given a fixed n, number of integers and (b) if the final problem is solvable, then give all guesses for that too and (c) if last problem is solvable, given a combination of integers written on the paper, you have to tell after how many incorrect guesses will Cantor reach the correct answer (according to your own algorithm).
